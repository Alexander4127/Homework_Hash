# Homework_Hash
Tests are written after the code(class functions)
The first check the time of inserting a lot of different elements.
The second adds many equal elements and uses real_hash(dictionary) to know correctness of our structure in this unpleasant situation. There is cycle in this part and
I'm not sure how useful is it, but the main idea - to find the mean of measuring(gauge it yourself to exclude any lags with the first iteration), you can also use it in other tests.
The third check correctness in each removing, this code uses extra structures too, so, the work time of lasts won't be measured correctly.
Each part include exit(0) - I should inform you about it, because sometimes I forget about if myself.
Besides, each test show the work time for your comfort.
